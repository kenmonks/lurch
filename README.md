# Lurch Plus!

### Ken Monks - University of Scranton - 2024

Lurch plus other goodies! Math 299 is the undergraduate Introduction to Proof course for math majors at the University of Scranton.  This repository contains all of the rule definition libraries and homework assignments given on Lurch during the Spring 2024 semester.  The file `index.html` has links to those documents, and some other information.  It can be accessed via Github Pages at [lurch.plus](http://lurch.plus). 

To use this as a template for your own Lurch course content, simply fork this repository to your own account, and then use Github Pages to serve the files from your forked copy.  This is explained in more detail at [lurch.plus](http://lurch.plus). To enable the optional node utilties, run `npm install` in the `lde` folder.
