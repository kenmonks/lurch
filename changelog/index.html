        <ul class="square">
          <li
            ><strong>ChangeLog Page!</strong> - added this changelog page to
            this site. 😎</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Improved parser docs page</strong> - made it easier to
            enter lengthy expressions in the
            <a href="/lde/src/experimental/parsers/lurch-parser-docs.html"
              >parser docs page</a
            >, by making the input text area full width and auto-resizing
            vertically to fit content. Improved overflow and resizing for the
            rendering and meaning outputs.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Fit-to-Content environment option</strong> - environment
            widths can be toggled between full width and just wide enough to fit
            their contents (and centered) from the right-click context menu.
            This is useful for examples like the
            <a href="/student.html?load=math/examples/group-example.lurch"
              >group theory example</a
            >, or
            <a
              href="/student.html?load=math/examples/Linear-Algebra-Examples.lurch"
              >linear algebra examples #2 and #3</a
            >, where you want to want to define a formula (i.e., a single
            expression rule) temporarily for a particular problem (as opposed to
            adding it to the context).</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Environment labels</strong> - can be customized and toggled
            on and off from the right-click context menu. The new default is to
            hide them, since they are redundant (the environment background
            colors distinguish them).</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Full screen mode</strong> - is available on the toolbar and
            via the context menu if you right-click anywhere in the editor.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Group Theory and Linear Algebra examples</strong> - added
            to the <a href="/#examples">examples gallery</a> on the home page.
            The group theory example uses the Linear Algebra context.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Linear Algebra Context</strong> - added a
            <a href="/instructor.html?load=math/Linear-Algebra-Rules.lurch"
              >starter context for Linear Algebra</a
            >
            for two and three dimensional vector spaces over the reals. It
            defines linear transformation and subspace. It is not enough for an
            entire course, but more rules and definitions can be added in the
            future.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Friendly Rule Name Options</strong> - the the Algebra Rule
            can now be specified by entering
            <code>&quot;algebra rule&quot;</code> (case insensitive, double
            quotes are required) as a single expression in a rule environment,
            instead of <code>AlgebraRule</code> (case sensitive). Similarly,
            <code>&quot;equations rule&quot;</code> or
            <code>&quot;chains rule&quot;</code> can be used instead of
            <code>EquationsRule</code> or <code>ChainsRule</code>. This makes it
            easier to format the rule in a more natural mathematical way,
            instead of the more computery camel case originals (which still work
            for backward compatibility).</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Error highlight in parser docs</strong> - the input text
            area on the
            <a href="/lde/src/experimental/parsers/lurch-parser-docs.html"
              >parser docs page</a
            >
            now turns red when the contents can’t parse.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Algebra Rule includes Arithmetic($\mathbb{Q}$)</strong> -
            the Algebra Rule now validates inequalites which can be checked by
            the Arithmetic($\mathbb{Q}$) rule.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>New Infix Operators</strong> - the expressions
            <code>x star y</code>, <code>x oplus y</code>,
            <code> x otimes y</code>, and <code>x odot y</code> now render as
            $x\star y$, $x\oplus y$, $x\otimes y$, and $x\odot y$ respectively.
            Semantically they are treated as $n$-ary operators. For example,
            <code>x star y star z</code> means <code>(★ x y z)</code> under the
            hood in putdown notation.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Matrix Product and Inverses</strong> - the expression
            <code>dot([[a,b],[c,d]],[[e,f],[g,h]])</code> formats as
            $\left[\begin{matrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{matrix}\right]
            \cdot \left[\begin{matrix} e &amp; f \\ g &amp; h
            \end{matrix}\right]$ and <code>inv([[a,b],[c,d]])</code> formats as
            $\left[\begin{matrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d
            \end{matrix}\right]^{-1}$. This notation is compatible with
            Algebrite, so can be used with <code>by algebra</code> to validate
            identities.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Added $\neq$ support</strong> - the Arithmetic rules now
            can validate the $\neq$ relation in addition to $=$, $&lt;$, and
            $\leq$.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Column Vector Support</strong> - placing a tick mark after
            a tuple or matrix transposes the output (but not the internal
            meaning). This allows a user to format the output of tuples as
            column vectors.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Custom Parsing Tracer</strong> - wrote a development tool
            for tracing the parsers when debugging, and integrated it with Lode.
            Only useful for developers who are customizing the parsers.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Indexed Product support</strong> - added to the $\LaTeX$
            parser so that <code>product(E(n),n,a,b)</code> formats as
            $\displaystyle\prod_{n=a}^{b} E\left(n\right)$. Additional forms of
            input might be added later, corresponding to how it handles indexed
            sums, with some reasonable precedence.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Absolute value support</strong> - added to the $\LaTeX$
            parser so that <code>abs(x)</code> formats as $\left|x\right|$.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>100 Theorem Challenge</strong> - added Theorem 66 proof by
            Dan Cerra, and updated the context of Theorem 1.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Improved formatting of Summations in Products</strong> -
            there was a parsing bug that would prevent expressions entered as
            <code>sum(f(k),k,0,n)*x</code> from parsing because summation was
            higher precedence than products. Now products have a higher
            precedence than summations, and the tex formatter takes this into
            account when deciding whether to add parentheses around a
            summation.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Algebra Rule Support in Transitive Chains</strong> - Users
            can now use cite ‘by algebra’ after any equation within a transitive
            chain when the Algebra Rule is available to check simple algebric
            identities by CAS.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Even More Efficiency Improvement</strong> - Lurch is now 31
            times faster at validating typical documents than it was in May
            2024. Multiple things contributed, but the main one was only
            instantiating one expression per pass for a given rule to avoid lots
            of duplicates. There is quite a bit of finesse required to do that
            in a way that doesn’t avoid instaitiations.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Expression editor checks both parsers</strong> - upgraded
            the expression editor dialog so it forbids any Lurch notation that
            can’t parse with both parsers, LaTeX and putdown (it was only
            checking conversion to LaTeX).</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Symbol Names with Spaces</strong> - You can now use double
            quoted strings containing spaces as symbol names, e.g.,
            <code>declare is, &quot;natural number&quot;</code> and
            <code>Assume n is a &quot;natural number&quot;</code>. Here,
            “natural number” is a single Lurch symbol. In the editor, the
            surrounding quotes are hidden, so the latter expression appears
            simply as <code>Assume n is a natural number</code> as desired. If
            user-defined MixFix operator capability is implemented in the
            future, double quotes may no longer be necessary.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Summation notation fix</strong> - Summations no longer
            require parentheses around the upper or lower bound when the bound
            is a sum.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Improved Rule Searching Interface</strong> - The search
            tool input box now gets focus when the hotkey to show the context is
            pressed. The hotkey still functions when focus is in the search box.
            It also puts a nice title on the search results and gives an
            informative message when no rules match the search string.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Clear Feedback on Remove Environment</strong> - if there
            are validation feedback icons in the document and the user selects
            the <code>Remove this environment</code> context menu item, it now
            clears the feedback icons. Any document change that may affect
            validation should also clear existing feedback. This was one of the
            missing edge cases.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Modal Validation Dialog</strong> - replaced the non-modal
            validation progress notification with a modal dialog. Also added an
            application setting that determines if it will show a
            <code>Validation... done!</code> message for 0.75 seconds when
            validation completes. In progress validation can be terminated
            immediately by pressing the escape key or closing the dialog. Using
            a modal dialog has two advantages:
            <ol>
              <li
                >It prevents the user from editing the document while validation
                is in progress, and potentially receiving incorrect feedback as
                a result.</li
              >
              <li
                >If the user edits an expression while validation is in
                progress, when the notification closed it would also close the
                user’s expression editor dialog.</li
              >
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li
            ><strong>Expository Math Dialog Label</strong> - added a label and
            tooltip to distinguish it from the meaningful math dialog.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Lurch notation</strong> - The Lurch notation ‘neg’ and
            ‘not’ both semantically parse the same way, but ‘neg’ renders as
            $\neg$, while ‘not’ renders as <code>not</code></li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Context Display Overhaul</strong>
            <ul class="dash">
              <li

          <li
            ><strong>Added MathLive and KaTeX locally</strong> to the Lurch
            repository to prevent Lurch rendering from breaking when the cdn
            doesn’t deliver MathLive (as happened with the upkg and the current
            version used by Lurch)</li
