 *  This file contains the code for the Global n-compact validation algorithm

//  TODOs: 
//  * For each attribute we use, decide whether it should be stored cached as a
//    permanent LC attribute or a normal js object attribute before moving to
//    the repo.  One challenge with this is that LC attributes are the only ones
//    that get copied when using .copy(), so that limits where you can put an
//    attribute depending on if you do/do not want to .copy() it when making
//    copies.
//  * Optimizations: for a rule like symmetry of equality, it will ALWAYS be
//    instantiated twice for every equation in the user's doc.  Figure some way
//    to improve that situation in general.
//  * Eliminate, replace, or improve on BIHs. 
//    * Add "Consider" options that are force-matched to lone metavariable and
//      EFAs.
//    * When an EFA has a parameter that is partially instantiated, leverage
//      that by allowing it to match expressions that contain the partial
//      instantiations.
//    * Along these lines, one 'strategy' is to consider 'BIH-makers', namely
//      what kinds of natural, minimal things can a user enter when doing, say,
//      substitution, that would be a tiny enough hint that Lurch could
//      construct an entire BIH from it?
//  * Consider speeding up matching in several ways.
//    * Allow an option to eliminate the constant lambda expression as a
//      solution.
//    * Allow an option to efficiently solve 'Weeny' matching problems. e.g.,
//      if (@ P c) where P is a metavar and c is a constant is matched to e, and
//      e does not contain c, return the constant solution (or none if the
//      previous option is enabled).  If e only has one instance of c, there's
//      only one solution, so return that without recursing.  If it has two
//      instances there are four solutions, so return those.  Three have eight.
//      That should cover about 99% of the cases.
//  * Design a generic way to use multiple validation tools in the same document
//    so they work well together.  For example, to have a CAS rule work with
//    this 501 validation tool we might insert a placeholder formula like `:{
//    CASRule }` and when an expression is supposed to be validated by the CAS
//    rule it can put 'instantiations' after that formula to make a valid CAS
//    expression validate propositionally.
//  * The following algorithm makes several passes through the entire document
//    to process each step/phase separately for testing and experimenting. It
//    might be more efficient to make one pass through the entire document,
//    modifying everything as you go. Update: initial benchmarks seem to
//    indicate that ALL of the computation time is coming from finding all of
//    the instantiations, so this probably doesn't matter.  Furthermore, initial
//    tests seem to indicate that that in an interactive UI almost everything
//    this algorithm does will be almost instantaneous.  So optimization would
//    mainly only affect batch mode instantiation of a large document from
//    scratch.
//  * Sometimes an instantiation will instantiate the variable in a Let with a
//    constant, either directly or indirectly, e.g. `Let 0'`. This doesn't seem
//    to hurt anything but it makes for stupid instantiations, and might speed
//    things up if we eliminate it.
//  * For rules like transitivity, e.g. :{ :x=y y=z x=z }, if used successfully
//    they get instantiated six times, once for each pair of metavariables, but
//    produce the same instantiation, plus a lot more.  However, these rules do
//    not have a forbidden expression like the metavar W or (@ P x), so they
//    don't automatically require a BIH.  But it is clearly nice to have such
//    rules.  So add an attribute marking it as 'inefficient', and treat Rule or
//    Part containing only a forbidden W or (@ P x) as a special case of
//    'inefficient' so that in every case a BIH is required.
//  * Make a substitution tool that does the following. 
//    - find any expressions of the form A~B (i.e., (~ A B)) where ~ is a
//      reflexive relation like =. ≤ etc, and A and B are expressions.
//    - compute the expression diff() between A and B, and see if there is a
//      nontrivial possible substitution, e.g. X=Y, that when applied to A~A
//      would produce A~B via substitution.
//    - add the instantiations
//
//         :{ A~A }           (of the reflexive rule for ~)
//
//      and
//
//         :{ :X=Y :A~A A~B } (of the substitution rule for =)
//
//    - do this for all expressions of the form A~B in the document.  This gives
//      us the main logic behind substitution by skipping the annoying
//      substitution BIHs for propositional expressions of this form. 
//
//    - make a similar tool for other common propositions to specify
//      substitutions, e.g. 
//
//        `Substituting x=y in ∀z,f(x,y)<z yeilds ∀z,f(y,y)<z`
//
//    - we may want to then add a special way to declare reflexive operators
//      rather than just inserting the various reflexive rules, e.g.,
//      reflexive_operator(=.≤,⊆)
//
//  * When the user enters a rule, it might be the case that they have used a
//    metavariable as both the function name in an EFA (like the P in 𝜆P(x))
//    and also as a non-EFA metavar (as in just P(z) instead of 𝜆P(z)).  We
//    probably should check that it doesn't do that.
//  * Along similar lines, we should check that instantiations don't create, e.g. 
//    Insts that have a bound constant or other idiosyncracies.

 *
 * ## Validate!
 *
 * This is the main routine! It requires that doc is an LC environment that has
 * already been interpreted, so if it has not, then it runs interpret() first.
 * It then runs all available validation tools that are compatible with
 * n-compact global validation. Finally, it runs global validation algorithm
 * itself, and returns the modified document with feedback stored in the various
 * locations.
 *
 * The optional second argument specifies which inference in the document should
 * be validated, and defaults to checking the entire document.  The optional
 * third argument determines if it should additionally check for preemies and
 * defaults to true. It defaults to the entire document.
 *
 * This function can be called with various different options set.  But rather
 * than trying to pass the options object along the chain of computation as an
 * optional argument, we just set a global `LurchOptions` object.  This allows
 *
 * The current validation tools available are the BIH tool, the Equations tool,
 * the Cases tool, and Scoping tool. These can be toggled or customized via the
 * settings object. In general, this routine provides the hook for installing
 * new n-compact global validation compatible tools in the future.  Validation
 * tools can add validation feedback and add additional complete instantiations
 * to the document, and can be run before or after instantiation, but should not
 * add new `Rules`.

// TODO: design this second idea much more carefully.  Here's why.  A typical
// large document without using this latter feature has, on average, about 2-3
// Insts for each conclusion in the user's document.  (Aside: that's kind of
// amazing and illustrates how instantiating non-forbidden Weenies is a very
// efficient way to find exactly those instantiations needed for a given user
// statement.)
//
// But the number of Insts (or Parts) created with this feature is equal to the
// number of conclusions, which is a substantial increase in both the number of
// Insts and size of the document but also the time it takes to produce them all.
// For example the time it takes for the current testing suite to complete
// doubles with this feature enabled.  So for now we will make the default to
// turn this off and still use the annoyng 'by cases' speedup.
//
// In the future, however, there are better more subtle ways to approach this.
// One idea is the following.
//
// * Split this routine into two separate routines, and run the first have that
//   processes cases> and 'by cases' BEFORE the main propositional instantiation
//   is done.
// * Then AFTER instantiating with the main loop, only instantiate the Parts (or
//   Rules, but more likely Parts) which have no other metavariables in them
//   besides the forbidden one. That will at least eliminate creating Parts up
//   front that then never turn into Insts afterwards.

// Validate helper utility.  This is the way the original validation tool worked
// but is now an internal helper utility to the `validate()` method, so we don't
// document this with jsdoc..
//
// Validate the target of this LC, store the result, and return true or false.
//
// This routine currently can use one or both of two validation modes: the
// propositional checker and the preemie checker.  The second and third optional
// arguments are booleans which specify whether it should be prop checked and
// preemie checked respectively.  This is useful for calling this efficiently
// from ._validateall.  If both are false, it does nothing and returns
// undefined.)
//
// With both modes, in order for this to provide more localized information
// about what is wrong with a proof, everything that is accessible to the target
// is temporarily treated as a Given, so that the propositional validity of a
// target is not dependent on the propositional validity of the things
// accessible to it.  
//
// We assume that every instantiation that will be required for computing the
// prop form and propositional validation has already been added to the
// document.  Thus, other Validation Tools, like BIH, and CAS, which might
// create instantiations, need to be run on the entire document before this
// final step as part of the instantiation phase.
//
// There are also some validation checks that may not need to instantiate
// anything, like checking that Let-environments don't violate the 'preemie'
// restriction by validating them without the initial Let() and making sure they
// are still valid and ignoring all tick marks on non-constant variables in
// instantiations or that are in the scope of a deleted Let. This check only
// makes sense when a target is propositionally valid, but should not be valid
// because of violating the preemie condition. So we only need to check for
// preemies only after doing propositional validation, and then only check the
// valid inferences in the scope of a Let or containing a Let.
//
// Just as for propositional checking, when checking to see if the target is a
// preemie, we do not care if anything accessible to it is a preemie. Keep in
// mind that by ignoring Lets, some of the things accessible to it might have a
// different propositional form (no tick marks on some variables in addition to
// being givens), but since they are temporarily treated as givens, even if they
// are preemies themselves, they will not be flagged as such.
//
// For targets which are Expressions or ForSomes we only check the target to see
// if it is a preemie, regardless of whether there might be other preemies in
// the LC.  But when the target is an environment, we only check if it is a
// preemie by ignoring the Lets it is in the scope of and its own Let if it is a
// Let-env. Thus, this routine assumes that all descendant Let-environments of
// this environment have already been preemie-checked (which will be the case
// when ._validateall has been called).  Thus, this routine will tell you if the
// target is, itself, a preemie, but not if contains any preemies if you don't
// check for those first.  So it could return 'valid' for an environment, which
// is useful for ._validateall, but might be misleading if you don't interpret
// it correctly.
//
// Moral: use only for targets that do not contain any descendant
//        Let-environments, or just call ._validateall for environments that do.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Validate All
//
// Validate every claim in this LC, store the result, and return true or false.
// The optional second argument, if false tells it to do an ordinary
// propositional check but not check for preemies. This may be all that is
// needed in the case where the library or document doesn't contain any Lets and
// thus doesn't have to check for preemies.
//
// We do the propositional check efficiently as follows. First, check the entire
// document. If it's valid we are done and can mark everything valid. If not,
// frequently it will be the case that previous proofs were already valid, but
// the one we are working on isn't. So check the children of the document. The
// ones that are valid, mark everything inside them as valid. Then recurse in
// the children of any invalid proof until we reach just the individual
// conclusions that are invalid.
//
// If checkPreemies is true, we have to additionally check if any
// propositionally valid inferences were preemies or valid because they contain
// preemies.  This must only be checked after propositional validation is
// complete since it relies on those results to know what to check.
//
// We do the preemie check efficiently as follows.
// * If the target is not valid, we don't have to do anything.
// * If the target is valid and not an environment, we just call ._validate on
//   the target with checkPreemies=true. Update the validation result of the
//   target and its valid ancestors if it is a preemie. 
// * If the target is a valid environment we do the following.  
//   - Get all top level Let-env descendants of X (those not nested inside
//     another Let-env descendant of X).  
//   - If any exist, call ._validateall(-,true) on each of those recursively
//     until we reach one that has no Let-env descendants.
//   - for the base case of the recursion, when a Let environment is reached
//     that does not contain any Let-environment descendants, validate it with
//     checkPreemies=true, and follow the same algorithm as for the
//     Propositional check above (if it's preemie-valid we're done because
//     everything is already prop valid, and if any of the conclusions were
//     preemies the whole thing would be invalid. So if it's not preemie valid,
//     recurse into the environment tree to locate the individual preemies it
//     contains as for prop checking).
//   - when the recursion is complete, do the same check on the ancestor
//     Let-env, by omitting just it's own Let and the Let's it is in the scope
//     of, but not the ones that are descendants.  This will detect any
//     additional preemies that are descendants but not inside descendant
//     Let-envs. If any new ones are found or if one of the recursive checks
//     found a preemie, in either case mark them and the parent being checked as
//     invalid for reason 'contains preemie'.
