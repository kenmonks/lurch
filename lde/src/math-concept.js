 * The MathConcept class, an n-ary tree of MathConcept instances, using functions
 * like {@link MathConcept#parent parent()} and {@link MathConcept#children children()}
 * to navigate the tree.
 *
 * In many ways, this is an abstract base class.  Yes, you can construct instances of
 * it, and the test suite does so to verify that all the features herein work.  But in
 * actual applications, it will primarily (perhaps exclusively) be subclasses of this
 * class that are instantiated.  There are two such types of subclasses:
 *
 *  1. LogicConcepts, which the LDE knows how to process for validating variable
 *     scoping and correctness of logical inference
 *  2. MathConcepts that are not merely logical, and thus can be arbitrarily complex
 *     (such as a chain of equations, or a set of exercises), but which can be broken
 *     down into many LogicConcepts algorithmically, for processing by the LDE.
 *     This algorithmic breakdown is implemented in the
 *     {@link MathConcept#interpretation interpretation()} function, which in this
 *     abstract base class returns simply an empty list, meaning "no LogicConcepts."
 *
 * This second category of subclasses is not intended to be fully specified, but can
 * grow and change over time, as new classes in that category are developed.

     * MathConcept trees can be represented using a notation called

     * represent LogicConcepts, {@link LogicConcept.fromPutdown as documented
     * here}.  (Both of these are, of course, plays on the name of the famous
     * format "markdown" by John Gruber.)
     *
     * Smackdown supports all notation used in putdown (so readers may wish to
     * begin learning about smackdown by following the link above to first
     * learn about putdown) plus the following additional features:
     *
     *  * The notation `$...$` can be used to represent a {@link LogicConcept
     *    LogicConcept}, for example, `$x^2-1$`.  The use of dollar signs is
     *    intentionally reminiscent of $\LaTeX$ notation for in-line math.
     *     * Note!  `$x^2-1$` is merely an example stating that mathematics
     *       *of some sort* can be placed between the dollar signs; it is
     *       *not* an indication that the specific notation `x^2-1` is
     *       supported.
     *     * At present, *no* notation is supported, and any text between
     *       dollar signs is simply stored as a {@link MathConcept
     *       MathConcept} instance with attribute "Interpret as" set to
     *       `["notation","X"]`, where X is the contents of the `$...$`
     *       (without the dollar signs)---e.g., `["notation","x^2-1"]`.
     *     * We will later add support for defining custom mathematical
     *       notation for use in `$...$` expressions, and then create a more
     *       robust way to {@link MathConcept#interpret interpret()}
     *       MathConcept trees into {@link LogicConcept LogicConcepts}, which
     *       will parse such notation to create real expressions.
     *     * To include a literal `$` inside a `$...$` section, escape it as
     *       `\$`.
     *  * The notation `\command{argument1}...{argumentN}` is also
     *    intentionally reminiscent of $\LaTeX$ notation, and has an analogous
     *    meaning: some command applied to a sequence of $N$ arguments.  For
     *    now, only the following commands are supported.
     *     * `\begin{proof}` and `\end{proof}` are replaced with ` { ` and
     *       ` } `, respectively, so that they can be used to construct {@link
     *       Environment Environments}, which is the meaning one would expect.
     *     * `\label{X}` is interpreted as if it were putdown notation for
     *       adding a JSON attribute to the preceding {@link LogicConcept
     *       LogicConcept}, associating the key "label" with the value X.
     *     * `\ref{X}` is exactly like the previous, but using attribute key
     *       "ref" instead of "label."
     *     * Any other command is stored as a {@link MathConcept MathConcept}
     *       instance with attribute "Interpret as" having the form
     *       `["command",...]`, for example, `\foo{bar}{baz}` would become
     *       `["command","foo","bar","baz"]`.
     *
     * The two notations given above will work hand-in-hand more over time.
     * Specifically, we will create types of `\command`s that can define new
     * notation to appear inside `$...$` blocks.
     *
     * For now, this routine fully supports parsing smackdown notation, but
     * does not yet obey a robust set of commands, only those shown above.
     *
     * @param {string} string the smackdown code to be interpreted

     * This function is a temporary placeholder.  Later, a sophisticated

     * representation of their document into a hierarchy of
     * {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} instances.
     * 
     * (In fact, we will actually use the
     * {@link MathConcept#interpret interpret()} function when we do so, and
     * remove this one.  That one is the official permanent interpretation API.)
     *
     * For now, we have this simple version in which many features are not yet
     * implemented.  Its behavior is as follows.
     * 
     *  1. The method of interpretation that should be followed is extracted
     *     from the "Interpret as" attribute of this object.  If there is no
     *     such attribute, an error is thrown.  The attribute value should be
     *     an array, call it $[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$, where $a_1$ is the method of
     *     interpretation and each other $a_i$ is some parameter to it.
     *  2. If $a_1$ is "class" then $a_2$ must be the name of some subclass of
     *     {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept}, and this routine will contruct a
     *     new instance of that class, copy all this object's attributes to
     *     it, and give it a children list built by recursively interpreting
     *     this MathConcept's children.
     *  3. If $a_1$ is "notation" or "command" then a single {@link Symbol
     *     Symbol} will be created whose text content states that support for
     *     interpreting the notation or command in question has not yet been
     *     implemented.
     *  4. If $a_1$ is anything else, an error is thrown.
     *
     * @returns {LogicConcept} the meaning of this MathConcept, subject to the
     *   limitations documented above
     *
     * @see {@link MathConcept.fromSmackdown fromSmackdown()} (which creates
     *   MathConcept hierarchies intended for interpretation)
