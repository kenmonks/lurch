          >We can extend Propositional Logic by adding more statements and rules

        <h2>Bound variables and lambda expressions</h2>
        <p
          >Many math expressions contain identifiers which are variables that
          have no meaning outside of the expression. For example, in an
          expression like $\sum_{k=0}^n k^3$, the variable $k$ is bound to the
          expression in the sense that has no meaning outside the expression
          itself. Indeed, we can replace it with any other letter that is not
          declared to be a constant to obtain an expression with the exact same
          meaning, like $\sum_{i=0}^n i^3$.</p
        >
        <div class="Def">
          <p
            ><strong class="qu">Definition <span class="thm"></span>.</strong> A
            <em>binding</em> is an expression of the form $x.E$ where $x$ is any
            non-constant identifier and $E$ is any expression. All occurrences
            of $x$ in $x.E$ are said to be <em>bound variables</em>. All
            identifiers in $x.E$ other than constants or bound variable are
            called <em>free variables</em>. An operator applied to a binding is
            called a <em>quantifier</em>.</p
          >
        </div>
        <p
          >We can apply a constant operator $\lambda$ to a binding expression
          $x.E$ to form the expression $\lambda x.E$ called
          <em>lambda expressions</em>. Such expressions can be applied to an
          expression $a$ to form a new expression, $(\lambda x.E)(a)$. Another
          name for a lambda expression is <em>anonymous function</em> and they
          can also be written as $x\mapsto E$.</p
        >
        <p
          >These can be <em>evaluated</em> to form the expression obtained by
          replacing all occurrences of $x$ in $E$ with $(a)$ (no free identifier
          in $a$ should become bound as a result of the substitution). If we
          give a name to an anonymous function, e.g., if we define $f$ to be
          $\lambda x.E$ then the expression $(\lambda x.E)(a)$ is just the usual
          prefix notation for function application $f(a)$. In this situation we
          refer to $a$ as the argument of the anonymous function application.</p
        >
        <p
          >For example, $(x\mapsto x^3)(a)$ evaluates to $a^3$. Indeed, in many
          math textbooks they will write $f(x)=x^3$ instead of $f=(x \mapsto
          x^3)$, but the latter is usually what they mean. In this example, we
          have the usual evaluation of functions, e.g., $f(a)=a^3$, $f(2)=2^3$,
          and $f(x+1)=(x+1)^3$.</p
        >
        <p
          >Notice that simply replacing all occurrences of $x$ in $\lambda x.E$
          with another identifier that does not appear in $E$ produces a new
          lambda expression which evaluates to the same thing as the original
          lambda expression when applied to the same argument. Such lambda
          expressions are said to be <em>$\alpha$-equivalent</em>.</p

        <h2>Quantifiers and Statements of Predicate Logic</h2>
        <p
          >Predicate logic extends propositional logic by defining two
          additional quantifiers.</p

            The symbols $\forall$ and $\exists$ are <em>quantifiers</em>. The
            symbol $\forall$ is called “for all”, “for every”, or “for each”.
            The symbol $\exists$ is called “for some” or “there exists”.</p
          >
        </div>
        <p>We will encounter more quantifiers beyond just these two.</p>
        <p

            $x$ is any variable and $\mc{P}(x)$ any statement that results from
            applying a lambda expression $\mc{P}$ to $x$, then $(\forall
            x.\mc{P}(x))$ and $(\exists x.\mc{P}(x))$ are both statements.</p
          >
        </div>
        <p
          >We say that the <em>scope</em> of the quantifier in $(\forall
          x.W(x))$ and $(\exists x.W(x))$ is everything inside the outer
          parentheses. Sometimes the outer parentheses are omitted when the
          scope is clear from context. All occurrences of $x$ throughout the
          scope are said to be bound by the quantifier.</p

        <h2>Declarations</h2>
        <p
          >In addition to declaring global constants in our proofs we will also
          need to be able to introduce new identifiers into our proofs. Just
          like all expressions and environments, we will have one declaration
          that is an assumption and one that is a claim.</p

            and continues until the end of the environment containing it.</p

          just the assumption that $x_1,\ldots x_n$ are completely arbitrary
          unspecified things with no restrictions. A for-some-declaration is a
          claim that we can name arbitrary unspecified things that we know exist
          and satisfy the statement $W$.</p

          inference. Theorems are like Rules in that they can be used as
          formulas by considering their free variables to be metavariables.
          Thus, after we prove the major results about a particular topic, we
          can add those theorems to the list of rules we can use to prove
          additional results in new topic.</p

            Let $\langle r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\rangle$ be a sequence of binary
            operators on a set $A$. We say such a sequence is
            <em>mutually transitive</em> if and only if for every $a,b,c\in A$,
            and for every $1\leq i\leq j\leq n$, $$a\,r_i\,b \xand b\,r_j\,c
            \implies a\,r_j\,c$$ and $$a\,r_j\,b \xand b\,r_i\,c \implies
