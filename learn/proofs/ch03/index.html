        <p
          >We will define our formal systems and write our proofs in the
          language of mathematics. In this section, we give an overview of the
          major building blocks of this language. These will be defined more
          rigorously as they come up in actual formal systems.</p
        >
        <h2>Identifiers, Variables, and Constants</h2>
        <p
          >One of the first things we learn as children is how to name things.
          In mathematics, the names we give to our ideas and structures are
          strings or symbols we will call <em>identifiers</em>. Whenever we
          define a formal system, we can specify which strings and symbols are
          the identifiers in that system. Identifiers in mathematics come in two
          flavors, <em>constants</em> and <em>variables</em>.</p
        >
        <p
          >A <em>constant</em> can be thought of as an identifier that names a
          fixed, specific mathematical entity. Common examples of constants you
          have encountered in previous math courses like calculus are things
          like $7$, $\pi$, $\ln$, $\cos$, $+$, and $=$. They name a particular
          number or function or relation.</p
        >
        <p
          >A <em>variable</em>, on the other hand, can be thought of as a name
          for an unspecified individual mathematical entity, usually of a
          certain type. The most common identifiers used for this purpose in
          mathematics are a single lower case letter, upper case letter, or
          Greek letter, such as $x$, $P$, or $\alpha$.</p
        >
        <h2>Expressions</h2>
        <p
          >Identifiers can also be combined in various ways to form larger
          mathematical <em>expressions</em>. A single identifier is called an
          <em>atomic expression</em>. A mathematical expression comprised of
          more than one identifier is called a <em>compound expression</em>. The
          same identifier might appear more than once in a compound expression.
          Like variables, expressions will frequently represent a mathematical
          object of a certain type.</p
        >
        <p
          >For example, you may have seen expressions such as $y=x+1$. This
          compound expression contains two variables, $x$ and $y$, and three
          constants, $=$, $+$, and $1$.</p
        >
        <p
          >In addition to indentifiers, mathematical expressions often use
          punctuation and formatting to form expressions that are easier to
          read, or to distinguish or identify two expressions. Common
          punctuations used in mathematical expressions include parentheses,
          elipses, periods, and commas. Common formatting used includes
          superscripts, subscripts, and arranging expressions into columns or
          grids in various ways. For example, we use expressions like
          $$\binom{n}{n}x^n+\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+\binom{n}{0}$$
          $$a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n$$ $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1
          \end{pmatrix}$$</p
        >
        <p
          >Mathematical expressions can also contain English words in addition
          to symbols. For example, you may have seen piecewise functions defined
          by an expression like $$T(n)=\begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} &amp; \text{if
          $n$ is even} \\ \frac{3n+1}{2} &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
          Indeed, many mathematical expressions will consist entirely of English
          words. For example,“<em
            >The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle.</em
          >” is one such expression.</p
        >
        <p
          >As we embark on our journey to build mathematics from the ground up,
          we will say exactly which mathematical expressions constitute the
          statements in the formal systems we define. Generally speaking,
          statements can be thought of as mathematical expressions or sentences
          which can be said to be true or false – expressions which if you said
          them in a courtroom during a trial, a lawyer could accuse you of lying
          or telling the truth.</p
        >
        <p
          >For example, expressions like $2&lt;3$, $1+1=3$, and “<em
            >Every set is a subset of itself.</em
          >” are usually statements in mathematics because they are either true
          or false, whereas expressions like $x^2+1$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and
          $\triangle ABC$ usually are not. Notice, however, that we do not need
          to know whether a statement is true or false to know that it is a
          statement. For example, $x&lt;2$ is true if $x$ represents the number
          $1$ but false if it represents the number $2$. Either way, we can say
          that the expression $x&lt;2$ is either true or false, and therefore
          can be considered a statement.</p
        >
        <h3>Function Application</h3>
        <p
          >Despite the wide variety of notation used in mathematics, all
          compound expressions can be constructed by <em>applying</em> one
          expression to zero or more other expressions. For example, we can
          apply the atomic symbol $\gcd$ to the atomic symbols $x$ and $y$ to
          obtain the compound expression $\gcd(x,y)$. This process of creating a
          new compound expression from existing atomic or compound expressions
          is called <em>application</em> (or <em>function application</em>). The
          expression being applied is called the <em>operator</em> and the
          expressions it is being applied to are called the
          <em>arguments</em>.</p
        >
        <h4>Prefix, Infix, and List Notation</h4>
        <p>There are several common ways to denote compound expressions.</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li
            ><em>Prefix notation</em> The arguments are separated by commas,
            wrapped in parentheses, and placed to right of the operator (or as
            subscripts without the parenthesis), e.g., $\xop{op}({arg} _
            1,\ldots,{arg} _ n)$ , or as $\xop{op} _ { {arg} _ 1,\ldots,{arg} _
            n }$.</li
          >
          <li
            ><em>Infix notation</em> The arguments are separated by the operator
            (with spaces on both sides) e.g., $({arg}_1 \mathbin{\xop{op}}
            {arg}_2 \mathbin{\xop{op}} \cdots \mathbin{\xop{op}} {arg}_n)$. The
            outer parentheses can be omitted in cases where it is
            unambigous.</li
          >
          <li
            ><em>List notation</em> The operator and arguments are separated by
            spaces with the operator listed fist, and the entire thing is
            wrapped in parentheses, e.g.,
            $(\xop{arg}_1,\ldots,\xop{arg}_n)$.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >There are many other ways we can format compound expressions for
          specific operators, but these three are the most common.</p

        <h2>Environments</h2>
        <p
          >The statements in the formal systems used in mathematics generally
          consists of some syntactically well-defined collection of expressions
          and sentences. While some statements and theorems might consist of a
          single expression like $n+0=n$, much of everyday mathematics is
          expressed with statements and theorems that are comprised of multiple
          expressions arranged in nested structures according to a grammar
          involving keywords and punctuation.</p
        >
        <p
          >Indeed, we frequently organize the sentences in a book by collecting
          them together into nested hierarchical structures called chapters,
          sections, subsections, and so on. Similarly, statements in mathematics
          are also frequently organized by placing them into nested hierarchical
          structures called <strong>environments</strong>. Like other books, a
          math textbook can have environments such as chapters, sections,
          subsections, but will also frequently contain other more specialized
          mathematical environments, such as theorems, proofs, subproofs,
          definitions, declarations, examples, and many others.</p
        >
        <div class="example-box">
          <p
            ><strong>Example.</strong> Consider this statement that might be
            found in any calculus textbook.</p
          >
          <div class="Theorem">
            <p
              ><strong>Theorem</strong> (<em>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</em
              >) If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $F:[a,b]\to\RR$ is defined
              by $$F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt$$ then $F$ is differentiable on
              $(a,b)$, and $F’(x)=f(x)$.</p
            >
          </div>
          <p
            >Notice that this theorem statement is an English sentence,
            comprised of multiple expressions arranged inside the enclosing box
            according to a certain grammar. The grey box containing the theorem
            is an example of an environment.</p
          >
        </div>
        <p
          >Environments serve two main purposes. First, as the name suggests, an
          environment defines a scope that delineates where certain assumptions
          or definitions are assumed to be under consideration. In the previous
          example, the assumption that $f$ is continuous is restricted to the
          inside of the theorem environment that contains it. Similarly, if the
          author of a book says in Chapter 1, “<em
            >In this chapter we will assume that $n$ is a positive integer.</em
          >”, the reader would not normally assume that the same assumption
          about $n$ holds in Chapter 2. So the Chapter itself is acting as an
          environment in that situation.</p
        >
        <p
          >Second, environments can also be statements in or about the formal
          system itself. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus stated above is a
          theorem of calculus, and thus a statement. We will encounter four
          specific flavors of environments in the next chapter, when we discuss
          deduction.</p
