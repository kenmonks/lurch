        <p
          >We will define our formal systems and write our proofs in the
          language of mathematics. In this section, we give an overview of the
          major building blocks of this language. These will be defined more
          rigorously as they come up in actual formal systems.</p
        >
        <h2>Identifiers, Variables, and Constants</h2>
        <p
          >One of the first things we learn as children is how to name things.
          In mathematics, the names we give to our ideas and structures are
          strings or symbols we will call <em>identifiers</em>. Whenever we
          define a formal system, we can specify which strings and symbols are
          the identifiers in that system. Identifiers in mathematics come in two
          flavors, <em>constants</em> and <em>variables</em>.</p
        >
        <p
          >A <em>constant</em> can be thought of as an identifier that names a
          fixed, specific mathematical entity. Common examples of constants you
          have encountered in previous math courses like calculus are things
          like $7$, $\pi$, $\ln$, $\cos$, $+$, and $=$. They name a particular
          number or function or relation.</p
        >
        <p
          >A <em>variable</em>, on the other hand, can be thought of as a name
          for an unspecified individual mathematical entity, usually of a
          certain type. The most common identifiers used for this purpose in
          mathematics are a single lower case letter, upper case letter, or
          Greek letter, such as $x$, $P$, or $\alpha$.</p
        >
        <p
          >In this course, identifiers can be any case sensitive finite sequence
          of alphanumeric characters and mathematical symbols, excluding
          punctuation like commas, periods, spaces, and brackets, and a few
          reserved words that we will encounter later.</p
        >
        <h2>Expressions</h2>
        <p
          >Identifiers can also be combined in various ways to form larger
          mathematical <em>expressions</em>. A single identifier is called an
          <em>atomic expression</em>. A mathematical expression comprised of
          more than one identifier is called a <em>compound expression</em>. The
          same identifier might appear more than once in a compound expression.
          Like variables, expressions will frequently represent a mathematical
          object of a certain type.</p
        >
        <p
          >For example, you may have seen expressions such as $y=x+1$. This
          compound expression contains two variables, $x$ and $y$, and three
          constants, $=$, $+$, and $1$.</p
        >
        <p
          >In addition to indentifiers, mathematical expressions often use
          punctuation and formatting to form expressions that are easier to
          read, or to distinguish or identify two expressions. Common
          punctuations used in mathematical expressions include parentheses,
          elipses, periods, and commas. Common formatting used includes
          superscripts, subscripts, and arranging expressions into columns or
          grids in various ways. For example, we use expressions like
          $$\binom{n}{n}x^n+\binom{n}{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+\binom{n}{0}$$
          $$a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n$$ $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1
          \end{pmatrix}$$</p
        >
        <p
          >Mathematical expressions can also contain English words in addition
          to symbols. For example, you may have seen piecewise functions defined
          by an expression like $$T(n)=\begin{cases} \frac{n}{2} &amp; \text{if
          $n$ is even} \\ \frac{3n+1}{2} &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
          Indeed, many mathematical expressions will consist entirely of English
          words. For example,“<em
            >The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle.</em
          >” is one such expression.</p
        >
        <p
          >As we embark on our journey to build mathematics from the ground up,
          we will say exactly which mathematical expressions constitute the
          statements in the formal systems we define, which will be a subset of
          the more general language of mathematics we are describing here.</p
        >
        <p
          >Generally speaking, statements can be thought of as mathematical
          expressions or sentences which can be said to be true or false –
          expressions which if you said them in a courtroom during a trial, a
          lawyer could accuse you of lying or telling the truth. For example,
          expressions like $2&lt;3$, $1+1=3$, and “<em
            >Every set is a subset of itself.</em
          >” are usually statements in mathematics because they are either true
          or false, whereas expressions like $x^2+1$, $\frac{1}{2}$, and
          $\triangle ABC$ usually are not. Notice, however, that we do not need
          to know whether a statement is true or false to know that it is a
          statement. For example, $x&lt;2$ is true if $x$ represents the number
          $1$ but false if it represents the number $2$. Either way, we can say
          that the expression $x&lt;2$ is either true or false, and therefore
          can be considered a statement.</p
        >
        <h3>Function Application</h3>
        <p
          >Despite the wide variety of notation used in mathematics, all
          compound expressions can be constructed by <em>applying</em> one
          expression to zero or more other expressions. For example, we can
          apply the atomic symbol $\gcd$ to the atomic symbols $x$ and $y$ to
          obtain the compound expression $\gcd(x,y)$. This process of creating a
          new compound expression from existing atomic or compound expressions
          is called <em>application</em> (or <em>function application</em>). The
          expression being applied is called the <em>operator</em> and the
          expressions it is being applied to are called the
          <em>arguments</em>.</p
        >
        <h3>Prefix, Infix, and List Notation</h3>
        <p>There are several common ways to denote compound expressions.</p>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li
            ><em>Prefix notation</em> The arguments are separated by commas,
            wrapped in parentheses, and placed to right of the operator (or as
            subscripts without the parenthesis), e.g., $\xop{op}({arg} _
            1,\ldots,{arg} _ n)$ , or as $\xop{op} _ { {arg} _ 1,\ldots,{arg} _
            n }$.</li
          >
          <li
            ><em>Infix notation</em> The arguments are separated by the operator
            (with spaces on both sides) e.g., $({arg}_1 \mathbin{\xop{op}}
            {arg}_2 \mathbin{\xop{op}} \cdots \mathbin{\xop{op}} {arg}_n)$. The
            outer parentheses can be omitted in cases where it is
            unambigous.</li
          >
          <li
            ><em>List notation</em> The operator and arguments are separated by
            spaces with the operator listed fist, and the entire thing is
            wrapped in parentheses, e.g.,
            $(\xop{arg}_1,\ldots,\xop{arg}_n)$.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >There are many other ways we can format compound expressions for
          specific operators, but these three are the most common.</p

        <p
          >From now on, when we use the term <strong>expression</strong> we will
          mean either an identifier or a compound expression formed by applying
          an expression to one or more expressions via function application, as
          illustrated in the table. Notice that the exponentiation operator
          $\text{^}$ is usually omitted and formatted with the second argument
          as a superscript in traditional math notation. Similarly, is also
          commonplace in mathematics to omit explicit multiplication symbols in
          algebraic expressions like $3x^3+2x-1$, but in this course we will
          always write it explicitly, like $3\cdot x^3+2\cdot x-1$.</p
        >
        <h3>Precedence</h3>
        <p
          >Prefix and list notation include parentheses, so their meaning is
          unambiguous, but compound expressions that combine different infix
          operators sometimes require parentheses to disambiguate them. For
          example, if $\star$ and $\diamond$ are infix operators and we write $a
          \star b \diamond c$ does that mean $(a \star b) \diamond c$ or $a
          \star (b \diamond c)$. In list notation, the former is $(\diamond\xs
          (\star\xs a\xs b)\xs c)$ whereas the latter is $(\star \xs a\xs
          (\diamond\xs b\xs c))$. In such a situation, we can use parentheses to
          disambiguate which one we mean.</p
        >
        <p
          >We can eliminate extra parentheses and reduce clutter by assigning
          <em>precedence</em> to the operators. In the example $a \star b
          \diamond c$ if we say that $\star$ has higher precedence than
          $\diamond$ we are asserting that this expression should be interpreted
          as $(a \star b) \diamond c$. If we say that $\diamond$ has higher
          precedence than $\star$ then it would be interpreted as $a \star (b
          \diamond c)$. If the operators have the same precedence, then the
          expression is ambiguous and therefore syntactically invalid.</p
        >
        <p
          >Some operators have universally accepted precedence, for example in
          elementary arithmetic, multiplication $\cdot$ has higher precedence
          than addition $+$, so that $3\cdot x+1$ is interpreted as $(3\cdot
          x)+1$, not $3\cdot(x+1)$. Other choices of precedence are not as
          universally accepted and may vary from textbook to textbook. In this
          course we will use the following precedence for the operators.</p

        <h2>Environments</h2>
        <p
          >The statements in the formal systems used in mathematics generally
          consists of some syntactically well-defined collection of expressions
          and sentences. While some statements and theorems might consist of a
          single expression like $n+0=n$, much of everyday mathematics is
          expressed with statements and theorems that are comprised of multiple
          expressions arranged in nested structures according to a grammar
          involving keywords and punctuation.</p
        >
        <p
          >Indeed, we frequently organize the sentences in a book by collecting
          them together into nested hierarchical structures called chapters,
          sections, subsections, and so on. Similarly, statements in mathematics
          are also frequently organized by placing them into nested hierarchical
          structures called <strong>environments</strong>. Like other books, a
          math textbook can have environments such as chapters, sections,
          subsections, but will also frequently contain other more specialized
          mathematical environments, such as theorems, proofs, subproofs,
          definitions, declarations, examples, and many others.</p
        >
        <div class="example-box">
          <p
            ><strong>Example <span class="thm"></span>.</strong> Consider the
            following theorem that might be found in any calculus textbook.</p
          >
          <div class="Theorem">

              by $$F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt$$ then $F$ is differentiable on
              $(a,b)$, and $F’(x)=f(x)$.</p
            >
          </div>
          <p
            >Notice that this theorem statement is an English sentence,
            comprised of multiple expressions arranged inside the enclosing box
            according to a certain grammar. The grey box containing the theorem
            is an example of an environment.</p
          >
        </div>
        <p
          >Environments serve two main purposes. First, as the name suggests, an
          environment defines a scope that delineates where certain assumptions
          or definitions are assumed to be under consideration. In the previous
          example, the assumption that $f$ is continuous is restricted to the
          inside of the theorem environment that contains it. Similarly, if the
          author of a book says in Chapter 1, “<em
            >In this chapter we will assume that $n$ is a positive integer.</em
          >”, the reader would not normally assume that the same assumption
          about $n$ holds in Chapter 2. So the Chapter itself is acting as an
          environment in that situation.</p
        >
        <p
          >Second, environments can also be statements in or about the formal
          system itself. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus stated above is a
          theorem of calculus, and thus a statement in that sense.</p
        >
        <h3>Theorems, Proofs, Rules, and Premises</h3>
        <p
          >We will have four kinds of environments - <em>Theorems</em>,
          <em>Proofs</em>, <em>Rules</em>, and <em>Premises</em> (capitalized
          when we want to refer to an environment of that type). A Proof
          environment that is inside of another environment is called a
          <em>Subproof</em> environment. Rather than lableing them, we will
          distinguish the four environment types visually by their background
          color (Rule - blue, Premise - cream, Theorem - grey, Proof - white) as
          shown.</p

          expressions (nested to any depth). We will see how the four
          environment types differ later on. For now we are just adding them to
          our language.</p
        >
        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p
          >In the toy proof systems we encountered in Chapter 2, the rules were
          not statements in the system. For example, <em>Rule 1</em> in the
          circle-dot system is not a circle-dot string, and
          <em>Spin Left</em> is not a sequence of colors in the Scrambler
          system. The conditional theorem stated and proved in
          <a href="/learn/proofs/ch02/#cat-dog-ex">Example 2.4</a> is not a
          theorem in the formal system, but rather a fact <em>about</em> that
          formal system. Namely, the system has the property that if
          <code>math</code> were a theorem then <code>cool</code> would be a
          theorem, too. Its proof shows why that claim is objectively valid.
          Indeed the proof shows something more general - that the Theorem holds
          in any formal system that satisfies Rule 1 and has
          <code>math</code> as a theorem.</p
        >
        <p
          >From this perspective we can view rules as assumptions about the
          formal system we are interested in, and Theorems as facts about any
          formal system satisfying those assumptions. In order to expand our
          language to support such Theorems, we need to add the concept of an
          <em>assumption</em>.</p
