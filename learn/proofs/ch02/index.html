            statement is <strong>objectively valid</strong>.</p

        <ul class="disc">
          <li
            ><strong>Veracity</strong> - we want to verify that a statement is
            <em>objectively valid</em>.</li
          >
          <li

        <h2>The Proof Spectrum</h2>
        <p
          >To be certain that our proof is correct, we need to be exceedingly
          careful and rigorous. To be clear in our exposition, we need to be
          succinct and elegant.</p
        >
        <p
          >To obtain elegant clarity without sacrificing correctness, we will
          begin with proofs that are objectively correct by virtue of the fact
          that they can be verified by a machine. This style of proof is called
          a <em>formal proof</em>. Then we will use a well-defined set of
          <em>proof shortcuts</em> to eliminate tedious, repetitive, and
          uninteresting parts of our proofs. Thus, we will construct a bridge
          between our formal proofs and the more
          <em>traditional proofs</em> found in journals, textbooks, and problem
          solutions.</p

        <h2>Rigor and Elegance</h2>
        <p
          >On the one hand, mathematical proofs need to be rigorous. Whether
          submitting a proof to a math contest or submitting research to a
          journal or science competition, we naturally want it to be correct.
          One way to ensure our proofs are correct is to have them checked by a
          computer. (Note that checking to see if a proof is correct is much
          easier for a computer to do than finding a proof in the first
          place.)</p
        >
        <p
          >There is much discussion in mathematics today about the value of
          computer verified proofs and their counterparts - rigorous, detailed,
          formal proofs. Many mathematicians and computer scientists have been
          making a strong case for formal, rigorous, computer-verified
          proofs.</p
        >
        <p
          >On the other hand, most mathematicians are attracted to mathematics
          because of its intrinsic beauty. A proof that communicates the key
          ideas of a proof to the reader in a succinct and beautiful way is very
          effective for its expository properties, even if it is not as rigorous
          as a formal proof. The legendary mathematician Paul Erdős always spoke
          of “The Book”, an imaginary book in which God had written down the
          best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. When he saw
          any particularly inspiring proof, he would exclaim “That proof is from
          ‘The Book’!”</p

        <p
          >We will strive for both rigor and elegance in our proofs by building
          a bridge between highly rigorous formal proofs and more elegant
          traditional proofs. We begin with formal proofs.</p

          individually becomes impractical. But fear not! There are many ways to
          overcome this limitation. For example, we might give some criterion

            system has infinitely many theorems, but we have specified them all

::: definition Proof
**Definition.** Let $P_1,\ldots,P_n$ be zero or more statements (called *premises*) and $Q_1, \ldots, Q_m$ be one or more statements (called *conclusions*) in a formal system. The system statisfies a *rule of inference* of the form

$$\m \text{if }P_1,\ldots,P_n {\blk\text{ then }} Q_1 \ldots Q_m$$

if whenever $P_1,\ldots,P_n$ are theorems, so are $Q_1, \ldots, Q_m$. There also may be *conditions* on when a particular rule of inference holds.
:::

In such a system we can consider an axiom to be a rule of inference that has no premises. This gives us another way determine if a statement is a theorem in a formal system whose theorems are defined recursively by rules of inference.

::: definition Proof
**Definition.** A statement $Q$ in a formal axiom system *follows from* $Q_1,\ldots,Q_n$ if $Q$ is a conclusion of a rule of inference with premises $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ and every premise is either a theorem or follows from from $Q_1,\ldots,Q_n$.
:::

In particular, if $Q$ is an axiom, then $Q$ is provable from no premises at all.  But there may be many other such theorems.

::: definition Proof
**Definition.** If $Q$ follows from no premises in a formal axiom system, we say that $Q$ is *provable* in the system. 
:::

Because the conclusions of rules of inference whose premises are theorems are themselves theorems, a provable statement is always a theorem.  If all theorems are defined this way we will say this is a *recursively defined formal system*.  This give us our first definition of a formal proof.

::: definition Proof 
**Definition.** A *proof* of a statement in a recursively defined formal axiom system is a sequence of applications of the rules of inference (i.e., *inferences*) that show that the statement is a theorem in that system. 
:::

In formal axiom systems whose theorems are defined recursively by rules of inference, the goal of the game we will play is to find such a proof to show that a given statement is a theorem. -->

            ><em>Scrambler!</em> is a formal proof system where the statements
            are finite sequences of colors. The Rules of Inference are
            permutations of these sequences (and so have one premise and one
            conclusion each). The goal is to apply the Rules to show that a
            given sequence of colors is provable from another given sequence of
            colors.</p

            ><em>Trix Game</em> is a formal proof system where the statements
            are positive integers. There are only two Rules of Inference, both
            of which take a single positive integer as a premise, and return a
            single positive integer as their conclusion. This system illustrates
            a rule that has a condition on when you can use it. The goal is to
            show that a given positive integer is provable from the premise $1$
            in the system.</p

            are just finite sequences of one or more circles and dots. This
            formal system has many of the features in common with actual
            mathematical formal axiom systems. There are five rules of
            inference, two of which are axioms. The goal is to prove various
