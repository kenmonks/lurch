        <h2>Reasoning with assumed expressions</h2>
        <p
          >Assumptions never require a feedback marker because they are just
          announcing that we are temporarily pretending it is true so we can
          determine the consequences if that were the case, not claiming that it
          actually is true. Once we assume something is valid we then can
          consider it valid as long as that assumption is in effect (until the
          end of the document, proof, subproof, or theorem that contains it).</p
        >
        <p>Let’s illustrate this with an example.</p>
        <div id="first-nested-ex" class="example-box">
          <p
            ><strong class="qu">Example <span class="thm"></span></strong> The
            following document environment has a Subproof environment on line 3,
            and expressions on lines 1,2,4,5. There are only two different
            statements in the entire proof
            <span class="m">$n$ is even</span> and
            <span class="m">$m$ is odd</span>. The first statement is assumed on
            line 1, and therefore valid as a claim everywhere after line 1. The
            second is assumed on line 3(a) inside the Subproof on line 3, and
            therefore is only valid until the end of that subproof (as seen on
            line 3.c), but no longer valid after that (as seen on line 5).
            Notice that the statements on lines 1 and 3.a do not get validity
            markers because they are assumptions.</p

          1=0,\quad 0\cdot 2=0,\quad 0\cdot 3=0,\quad \ldots $$ That’s
          infinitely many facts, so we can’t list them all. In algebra class we
          might state all of these facts using a <em>formula</em> like this
          $$0\cdot n=0$$ where the identifier $n$ can be replaced by any number
          we like to obtain a valid fact. We cannot, however, replace the other

            We write $$(W_1,\ldots,W_m \vdash V_1,\ldots,V_n)$$ for an if-then
            environment with premises $W_1,\ldots,W_m$ and conclusions
            $V_1,\ldots,V_n$. Similarly we write $$(W_1,\ldots,W_m \equiv
            V_1,\ldots,V_n)$$ for an iff environment.</p

        <h2>Theorems before their proof?</h2>
        <p
          >It is commonplace in mathematics to write a theorem immediately
          before its proof, which unfortunately would mean that the proof could
          be justified by the theorem rather than the other way around. To allow
          for this, we make the convention that if a Theorem environment occurs
          immediately before a Proof environment, then it will be treated as if
          they occur in the reverse order, with the Theorem coming after the
          Proof.</p
