        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p
          >The development of logic and mathematics over thousands of years is
          one of the great achievements of human cognition.</p
        >
        <p
          >On the one hand, its usefulness and practical importance in the
          modern world is hard to overstate. It provides a foundation upon which
          science, engineering, finance, medicine, economics, computer science,
          agriculture, and many other areas of human knowledge have been
          developed. But this fact raises an interesting question.
          <em>Why?</em></p
        >
        <p
          >Why is it that such a wide and disparate collection of applications
          from counting to cosmology all rely upon mathematics? Why are they
          built upon mathematics instead of something else like, say, music or
          poetry? Most of us recognize that mathematics is exceedingly useful,
          but <em>why</em> is it so useful?</p
        >
        <p
          >One possible reason is that it provides us with a reliable starting
          point on which to build <em>consensus</em>. A group can accomplish
          much more by working collaboratively than they can by working as
          separate individuals. But cooperation and collaborative
          decision-making require a consensus about the assumptions,
          terminology, and facts that allow us to communicate and inform our
          decisions.</p
        >
        <p
          >Mathematics and its underlying logic provide us with a tool that
          allows us to reason in a way that is reliable, objectively verifiable,
          and independent of our individual, personal, and subjective human
          biases. Mathematicians do not debate whether $5$ is larger than $4$,
          or whether $2+3=5$. The fact that mathematics can be verified
          objectively and reliably is what makes it a prototype for achieving
          consensus about mathematical facts. Other disciplines that can
          successfully build upon mathematics can then use it to construct a
          solid foundation for consensus about facts in their own subject
          area.</p
        >
        <p
          >In addition to being useful, mathematics is one of the most
          beautiful, creative, and sublime creations of the human mind. It is
          inherently valuable for its own sake as a work of art, to be enjoyed
          and shared with others, and passed down from generation to generation
          for thousands of years.</p
        >
        <p
          >For this reason, our introduction to mathematical proof must combine
          both the rigorous objectivity that is needed for determining and
          communicating mathematical facts, with the elegance and beauty that
          exemplifies any human art form.</p
        >
        <p
          >The main reason mathematics and logic are so amenable to building
          consensus is that
          <em>anyone can check a mathematical claim for themselves</em>. There
          is no need to believe anyone, cite any book, or consult any oracle. We
          can each take personal ownership of our mathematics by proving all of
          it ourselves.</p
        >
        <p
          >The goal of this course is to do exactly that. It will guide you on a
          personal journey to build and verify most of elementary mathematics
          from the ground up. It is a quest to objectively prove for yourself
          all of the basic elementary mathematical facts about logic, natural
          numbers, sequences, real numbers, set theory, functions, relations,
          and combinatorics.</p
        >
        <p
          >To accomplish this, we must begin by slowly and carefully defining
          exactly what constitutes a mathematical proof, how to construct them
          ourselves, and how to express them up in a way that allows them to be
          accurately and elegantly shared with others.</p
