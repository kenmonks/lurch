          ><a href="https://lurch.plus">Lurch Plus</a> is the official home of
          the Lurch proof verification project and its applications. In addition
          to housing the latest official version of the Lurch web application,
          it also contains supporting

            >topics, content, course materials, and assignments</a
          >
          from my undergraduate Introduction to Proof course, the
          <a href="../100">100 Theorem Challenge!</a>, and other Lurch-related
          goodies.</p
        >
        <h2 id="history">Project History</h2>
        <p
          >In 1995, I was teaching my undergraduate course on Chaos and
          Fractals, and at that time our department did not offer a bridge
          course to introduce students to mathematical proofs. To address this,
          I began the course with an introduction to mathematical proof, using a
          modified version of Gentzen's natural deduction. During the course,
          one of my students, Nathan Carter, asked if it was possible to develop
          a computer program to verify such proofs. This led to collaborative
          discussions and the initial design and implementation of a few simple
          tools before Nathan graduated and went off to graduate school in
          mathematics.</p
        >
        <p
          >Years later we revisited the project, and in 2008 we were awarded an
          NSF grant (NSF DUE CCLI grant #0736644) to develop the first version
          of the software. This desktop application, also known as Lurch, became
          a key part of my Introduction to Proof classes and the Prove It! Math
          Academy summer program.</p
        >
        <p
          >Building on lessons learned from the initial version, we completely
          redesigned and rebuilt Lurch from the ground up, transforming it into
          the modern web application it is today.</p
        >
        <p
          >In Spring 2024, I created the necessary content and introduced the
          new version of Lurch in my Introduction to Proof course. It was met
          with great success.</p
        >
        <h2 id="why_lurch">Why is it called 'Lurch'?</h2>
        <p
          >The origin story of the name actually involves a computer algebra
          system, types of trees (the plants, not the discrete structures), and
          a Monty Python skit.</p
        >
        <p
          >Back in the 1990's, Nathan and I were brainstorming designs for an
          application that would be an &quot;expert system for verifying
          mathematical proofs analogous to the way the Maple CAS is an expert
          system for doing algebraic computations&quot;. To distinguish the
          designs from each other and from Maple we named them after other trees
          besides Maple - Elm, Oak, Ash, Pine - you get the idea.</p
        >
        <p
          >We eventually named one after a particular tree that was made
          humorously famous by a Monty Python sketch - the Larch. But as the
          design evolved, we made a small adjustment and decided the result
          needed a slightly modified name. Enter Lurch. The name stuck, and we
          really can't imagine calling it anything else at this point.</p
