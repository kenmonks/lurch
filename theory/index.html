          <h2>How Lurch works its magic</h2>
        </div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p
          >You can use Lurch to check proofs without understanding
          <em>how</em> it is able to do so. For those of you who want to
          understand Lurch at a deeper level (or are just curious), here is a
          very brief high-level overview of how it works.$^{**}$</p
        >
        <p
          >We answer the question &quot;How does it work?&quot; from three
          different perspectives: for mathematicians, logicians, and computer
          scientists.</p
        >
        <p
          >In what follows we assume you have already read and understand the
          material in the
          <a href="../index.html#start">Quick Start Guides</a> and
          <a href="../student.html?load=../help/proofs-worksheet.lurch"

        >
        <h2 id="motivation">Motivation and Goals</h2>
        <p
          >One of the main goals of the Lurch project is to check proofs written
          in the natural mathematical style commonly found in undergraduate
          textbooks. Let’s identify some key characteristics of that style.
          Below is a theorem and proof from a randomly selected calculus
          textbook from my bookshelf.$^{***}$</p
        >
        <p
          ><img
            src="../assets/media/CalculusProof.png"
            alt="Calculus Proof"
            width="75%"
        /></p>
        <p class="smallskip"
          >Notice the following characteristics of such proofs.</p
        >
        <ul class="disc">
          <li
            ><strong>Theorems Are Sentences</strong> – The statements being
            proven are typically written as full sentences containing multiple
            mathematical expressions rather than a single formal mathematical
            expression like:<br />
            $$ \left(\forall x\in (a,b),f'(x)=0\right)\Rightarrow\left(\exists
            c,\forall x\in(a,b),f(x)=c\right) $$</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Minimal Justifications</strong> – Textbook proofs rarely
            provide explicit reasons for each step. In the example above, the
            only justification given is &quot;by the MVT&quot;.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Assumed Context</strong> – The proof relies on implicit
            background material, including previously stated content in the book
            or unstated prerequisite knowledge expected for the course.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Informal Logical Notation</strong> – Logical symbols such
            as $\Rightarrow, \Leftrightarrow, \vee, \wedge, \forall$, and
            $\exists$ are rarely used in such proofs. The example above contains
            none of them.</li
          >
        </ul>
        <p
          >Thus, one of the key motivations behind the Lurch validation
          algorithm is to support checking proofs with these characteristics,
          written in this informal yet rigorous style. Let’s explore how it
          achieves that.</p
        >
        <h2 id="math">Lurch Theory for Mathematicians</h2>
        <p
          >If you look at the example proofs in Lurch, one striking feature you
          may notice is that it does not require that you justify your claims
          with reasons or explain how you came to any particular conclusion. So
          how does it determine if your proof is valid?</p
        >
        <p
          >In simple terms, it begins by considering each statement in your
          document one at a time and asking &quot;What do we know about this
          statement?&quot;. To answer that question it looks at every
          definition, theorem, axiom, rule, and formula in the context or
          document content and checks each one to see if it has anything to say
          about the particular statement. Whenever it does, it adds the relevant
          fact to the list of known information. Finally, when all such facts
          have been determined and collected, it checks if your conclusions
          follow from the list of known facts.</p

        </div>
        <p
          >To convince Lurch, a proof must include sufficient detail to validate
          each claim. In practice, the only way to convince Lurch that a
          non-trivial proof correct is if you already know why you are entering
          each statement. If students only consider one rule at a time to
          motivate each claim in their proof, then Lurch will find the relevant
          facts and judge the proof to be valid. But if they skip steps (or have
          an incorrect proof) Lurch will not be convinced by their argument
          until they provide more detail and/or correct their mistakes. In this
          way, students are trained by Lurch to have a justification for every
          step without explicitly requiring them to do so (just like most proofs
          in textbooks).</p

        <p
          >The goal of Lurch is to be as natural, easy to use, and customizable
          as possible. Existing proof verification methods and foundations
          mathematics in the literature (e.g., Formal Axiom Systems, ZFC, Type
          Theory, Category Theory) are not particularly well-suited for that
          purpose. This motivates a different approach that is used by Lurch,
          which we now briefly explain.</p

          tell me what you think the word '<em>topic</em>' means. The only

          me what you think a '<em>theorem</em>' is. Without knowing what your
          topic is, or what you think a theorem is, I will now tell you a true
          fact about the theorems of your topic:</p

        <blockquote>
          <p
            >Either <span class="greyback">Gina loves mocha</span> is a theorem

          >
        </blockquote>
        <p
          >This is true about your topic because it's a tautology, and thus true
          by definition. In general, any propositional tautology whose atomic
          propositions are of the form '$t_0$ is a theorem of your topic',
          '$t_1$ is a theorem of your topic', '$t_2$ is a theorem of your
          topic', $\ldots$ '$t_n$ is a theorem of your topic' will be true about

        <h3>How does this help?</h3>
        <ul class="disc">
          <li
            ><strong>Natural Language Theorems</strong> – Modern Foundations of
            Mathematics like ZFC, Type Theory, Category Theory, frequently begin
            by defining a language - the set of syntactically valid statements
            in the mathematical topic that they are trying to formalize. 
            Lurch's foundation does not make any such restriction. You can
            define and say whatever you want. Theorems can be environments
            containing sentences and paragraphs, or a single expression.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Minimal Justifications</strong> – As illustrated in the
            example above, typical textbook proofs rarely provide explicit
            reasons for each claim. The Lurch validation algorithm supports this
            natural style.</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Customizable Context</strong> ‐ Lurch does not assume any
            mathematical or logical rules by default, so instructors and users
            are free to define their own from scratch. Proofs in undergraduate
            math textbooks rarely used formal operators like $\Rightarrow$,
            $\wedge$, $\forall$, or $\exists$. Lurch can validate such proofs
            because it also does not require them (or any other formal
            operator).</li
          >
          <li
            ><strong>Propositional Form</strong> – Lurch converts your entire
            document (context, assumptions, theorems and proofs ... all of your
            meaningful content) to a single proposition, and checks if that
            proposition is a tautology. You do not have to learn any
            Lurch-specific rules or reasoning. Yet doing proofs in Lurch 'feels'
            very natural, as illustrated by the following example.</li

              >Recall that any theorem in Neutral Geometry is true about both
              the Euclidean plane and the hyperbolic plane. Neither Euclid's
              parallel postulate $E$ nor its negation $\neg E$ can be proven in
              Neutral geometry, and either one can be added as an additional
              axiom without introducing a contradiction. Goedel's Theorem
              generalizes this situation by showing that for any sufficiently
              complicated consistent formal system there will always be a
              statement, $G$, such that neither $G$ nor $\neg G$ can be proven
              using that system, and either can be added to the system without
              introducing a contradiction.<br /><br
            /></p>
            <p
              >From the perspective of the foundation used by Lurch, these
              results simply say that we can always extend our context to prove
              results about things that are independent of the context (unless
              the context allows you to prove everything - the Lurch flavor of
              'inconsistent'). This is due to the fact that Lurch does not
              restrict to a particular formal language or assume any context by
              default. It allows you to start with any context, spotting
              whatever high level facts you like, as an alternative to requiring
              that every proof be built up from very low-level axioms.<br /><br
            /></p>

            >$^*$Most of the original ideas and designs discussed on this page
            were motivated by the desire to make Lurch as natural and user
            friendly as possible. Existing proof verification methods and
            foundations mathematics in the literature (e.g., Formal Logic
            Systems, ZFC, Type Theory, Category Theory) are not well-suited for
            that purpose. Some aspects of the design are still a work in
            progress and subject to modification. I intend to write up the
            details once the dust settles. In the meantime, if you have
            questions or would like to discuss these ideas further, feel free to

            order to use Lurch. It is just how I think about it. I find that
            having some deeper way of thinking about it can be helpful when
            creating your own contexts and assignments. <br /><br
